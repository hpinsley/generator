# We don't need to publish the ports unless we want to get to these endpoints from
# the host.  Since we may run this environment multiple times simultaneously, we would
# otherwise get a port-in-use error on the HOST port
# Rule-of-thumb: don't publish ports in a ci environment
#
# Sample usage:
# docker-compose up --force-recreate --abort-on-container-exit --build
